Coming into a new decade, we started "Hela Pawura" as an effort to digitize the Sri Lankan street art culture for the coming generations. But like all good 
things - this too has to come to an end. Which is why we're shutting down the "Hela Pawura" archive. Thank you all for the incredible support!
